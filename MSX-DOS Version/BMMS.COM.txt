----------------------------------------
     Bigger Memory Mapper Selector
    Version 0.4 for MSX-DOS1 by GDX
----------------------------------------

 BMMS is a program that selects the largest RAM expansion with
 Memory Mapper as Main-RAM.
 
 Note: This command is not useful for MSX1 unless your Memory Mapper is
       able to initialize their pages at initialization.

 Hardware Requirement:

 - Any MSX.
 - Any RAM expansion with Memory Mapper.


 Use:
 
 Put the file on the disk in root directory and run it on MSX-DOS1
 by entering the following command.
 
 BMMS

 You can put it in an AUTOEXEC.BAT.
 
 Notes for MSX1:

- If you do not have a Memory Mapper that initializes its pages when
  initializing the MSX, use BMMS for the BASIC environment, or place
  a 64KB extension in the lowest Slot.
- If you have only one Memory Mapper that does not initialize its pages,
  place it in a Slot lower than the other Mappers.
