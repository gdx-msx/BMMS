----------------------------------------
     Bigger Memory Mapper Selector
          Version 0.4 by GDX
----------------------------------------

 BMMS is a program that automatically selects the largest RAM
 expansion with Memory Mapper as Main-RAM.
 So BMMS is more efficient than the usual "universal POKE"*. It allows to run
 software that do not take account secondary slots or using without asking
 question the Memory Mapper in main RAM.
 BMMS sets the segments in order 3, 2, 1, 0 for MSX1s.

 (*) POKE-1,(15-PEEK(-1)\16)*17


 Hardware Requirement:

 - An MSX.
 - Any RAM expansion with Memory Mapper.


 Use:
 
 Put the file on the disk or tape and run it by entering the
 following command.
 
BLOAD"BMMS",R
 
 You can put it in an AUTOEXEC.BAS like following examples.

 Example to automatically execute a Basic program after BMMS:

10 BLOAD"BMMS",R
20 RUN "YOURPRG.BAS"


 Example to run the MSX-DOS:

10 BLOAD"BMMS",R
20 POKE &HF346,1: _CALL SYSTEM


 Versions history:

 v0.4

- The Turbo R is no longer supported when booting under Disk-Basic v2.01
  because the segment Protection System faults the segment search. Only the
  "universal POKE" entered in this case.
- No longer enters "universal POKE" when Main-RAM is in slot 0-X because it
  causes the crash of MSX2s based on the Daewoo CPC-300 for example.

 v0.3

- Fixed some bugs.
- File size is smaller.

 v0.2

- First version.
